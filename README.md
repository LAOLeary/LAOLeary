- 👋 Hi, I’m @LAOLeary
- 👀 I’m a former brain anatomist trying to get into coding, I love building things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C# and SQL. I made this on the 13th April 2021, had a massive pause when I became a regulatory writer, and am now back on it in July 2024.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on big data projects, especially those in the life sciences.
- 📫 How to reach me -> See my LinkedIn!
